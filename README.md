Send links to GitHub, Stackoverflow or other profile along with a solution (either in short video, diagrams, prose or code) to finding the sum of even-valued terms in a Fibonacci sequence where the sum of those terms does not exceed 5 million.
 
# Solution:

Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms.

Brute forcing, We know that the next number in the sequence is easy to calculate and we are looping at maximum 5 million times, in each loop we need to calculate the next number in the sequence, check if it is even and add the number to the result.
